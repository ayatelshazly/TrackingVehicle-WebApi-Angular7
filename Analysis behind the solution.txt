what i do in this project :
================
- in this build the skeleton of this project as 
 - Data Access Layer 
		- using CodeFirst EntityFrameWork
		- SQL Server
 - Business Layer 
	- DTO : Mapping (Customer , Vehicles) Classes with DAL Classes
 - Presentation Layer 
	- Angular 7 
 - UnitTest on :
	- Customers 
		- Get_AllCustomers_TestMethod: check if the count of data with my input is Identicall , check if the webAPI is runing well
		- Customer_FindName_TestMethod:check if specific CustomerName is found in our API Result
		- Customer_ListIsIdentical_TestMethod : check if the every single data with my input data is Identicall 
	- Vehicles 
		- Get_AllVehicle_TestMethod ..
		- Vehicle_FindVIN_TestMethod ..
		- Vehicle_ListIsIdentical_TestMethod


Problems that i faced :
===========================
First 
------
i was planning to build my structure (DAL ,BLL , API ) .NetFrameWork,  and then represent my data through Angular 7 
and make the Simulation of (Connect / disconnect) Vehicles by using SignalR ,  but i faced a big problem that SignalR
is not compatible  with (.NetFrameWork and Angular 7) , if you want to represent your data through Angualr 7

second:
---------
1- i decide to use .Net core , but if i make API .Net Core the other project will not be compatible with my API 
2- so i make it with Observable and set interval to call the WebAPI every specific interval , and that's was great
